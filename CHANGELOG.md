# 0.0.7

* Enhanced normal filter with cheerio idioms as it operates differently than
  jQuery (less forgiving).



# 0.0.6

* Fixed `normal` filter.



# 0.0.5

* Add a `normal` filter that strips out everything we assume we want stripped out
  as opposed to just the `none` filter which will likely not in general do what
  we want.
